title: Dragon Egg Reading Guide

---
##### Synopsis

When I came to, there I was—in a strange and unfamiliar forest.

Here, it seems apparent that it’s like a fantasy world, one brimming with magical and fantastical beasts. Far from being just a fantasy world, though, it would look as if I am able to peer into the numerical stats and abilities of my foes and I, not unlike that of a game.

Hunt down magical beasts, level up, rack up ⟨Titles⟩, and evolve into ever-higher-ranked dragons!

A mysterious and enigmatic voice echoing through my head pressures me; it’s tellin’ me: ⟦Aim for the strongest⟧!
